## Seemless data wrangling

The tidyverse is a bunch of packages and functions written by the folks that manages Rstudio.
The tidyverse builds upon base R to allow for easier use of large datasets.

## Install package tidyverse

install.packages("tidyverse")

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
microbiome.fungi <- read.csv("Assignments/Data_Wrangling/Bull_richness.csv")
```
